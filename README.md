Source files for a handount created in 2008 for a conference session on "Using IBM Task Modeler to create a DITA-based information set."

The are three sets of the DITA source files:
 * DITA 1.1: Uses conref for a product name variable
 * DITA 1.2: Uses keyref for a product name variable
 * DITA 1.3: Uses the troubleshooting topic and XML mention domain
 
The sample set uses best practices for technical communication, and the topics are information-typed.
